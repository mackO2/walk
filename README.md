## O2 Team Lockdown 2 Walking Challenge

Unable to physically walk the route from Land's End to John O'Groats during Lockdown 2, a number of the UK Networks' Projects & Programmes Management Team volunteered to walk the distance locally. Recording their steps, kilometeres and miles periodically using a Microsoft Form; a python script then processes the data which is then displayed on a simple static web page hosted on here on Github.
